Your task is to build a sophisticated Machine Learning model combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess sentiments of these quotes.

## Problem Statement
Love knows no gender and the __LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer)__ community is the epitome of this thought. During Pride Month, we are here with another Machine Learning challenge, in association with Pride Circle, to celebrate the impact and changes that they made globally.

---------

- You have been appointed as a social media moderator for your firm. 
- Your key responsibility is to tag and categorize quotes that are uploaded during __Pride Month__ on the basis of its sentiment, ```positive, negative, and random```. Your task is to build a ```sophisticated Machine Learning model combining Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP)``` to assess sentiments of these quotes.

## About the Dataset

The dataset consists of quotes that are uploaded during Pride Month.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using unsupervised Machine Learning techniques are as follows:

- This challenge encourages you to apply your unsupervised Machine Learning skills to build models that can assess sentiments of a quote.
- This challenge helps you enhance your knowledge of ```OCR and NLP``` that are a part of the advanced fields of Machine Learning and artificial intelligence.

You are required to build a model that analyzes sentiments of a quote and classifies them into <font color='red'><b>positive, negative, or random</b></font>.
